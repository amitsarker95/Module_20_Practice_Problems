<h6>10.For a sorted array, which of the following algorithms will take less time ? Explain with examples.<br>
  i)Bubble sort.<br>
  ii)Insertion sort<br>
 iii)Counting sort.<br>
 </h6>
 <h6>11. Write a function named insert_node() that inserts a value at the end of a singly linked list. If there are no nodes, it will insert a head.</h6>
 <h6>12. Write a function named insert_node_by_position() that inserts a value at any position of the singly linked list. You can assume that if there are 5 nodes in the list, the positions are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.</h6>
 <h6>13. Write a function named delete_node_by_position() that deletes a node from the singly linked list. If there is only one node left, it will delete the head.</h6>
 <h6>14. Write a function named count_node() to count the number of nodes in that singly linked list.</h6>
 <h6>15. Write a function named move_tail() which will move the tail to the first position of the list.<br>
         For example: If the list looks like this,<br>
         List: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 10 -> 5<br>
         After the operation the list will look like this,<br>
         List: 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 10<br>
</h6>
 <h6>16. Write a function insert_node() to insert a value at the end of a doubly linked list. If there are no nodes, it will insert a head.</h6>
 <h6>17. Write a function named insert_node_by_position() that inserts a value at any position of the doubly linked list. You can assume that if there are 5 nodes in the list, the positions are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.</h6>
 <h6>18. Write a function named delete_node_by_position() that deletes a node from the doubly linked list. If there is only one node left, it will delete the head.</h6>
 <h6>19. Write a function named move_head() which will move the head to the last position of the list.<br>
         For example: If the list looks like this,<br>
         List: 2 <-> 4 <-> 1 <-> 10 <-> 5<br>
         After the operation the list will look like this,<br>
         List: 4 <-> 1 <-> 10 <-> 5 <-> 2<br>
